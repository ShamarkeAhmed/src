# Project Idea: AI-Assisted Code Vulnerability Explainer

This project uses a large language model to help software developers understand security vulnerabilities in source code. 
This tool analyzes small code snippets and explains common issues such as SQL injection or hard-coded credentials in clear, simple language.

The goal is to support developers in writing more secure code by providing quick feedback and guidance, not to fully automate security auditing.
