**# Project Report: AI-Assisted Code Vulnerability Explainer

## 1. Main Obstacles
One challenge was designing prompts that produce consistent and precise outputs from the language model. Another challenge was balancing helpful explanations with avoiding overly verbose responses.

## 2. Main Results
The project resulted in a working prototype that can analyze short code snippets and provide understandable explanations of common security vulnerabilities. The tool demonstrates how large language models can support secure software development.

## 3. Use of Large Language Models
Large language models were used to:
- Analyze source code
- Identify vulnerability patterns
- Generate natural-language explanations and suggestions

Prompt engineering was iteratively refined to improve accuracy and clarity.

## 4. Next Steps
Future work could include:
- Adding retrieval-augmented generation for up-to-date vulnerabilities
- Supporting additional programming languages
- Integrating the tool into an IDE
